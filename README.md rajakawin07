## Overview

Jito is supporting the bundle service that you can confirm 4 transactions (This is maximum from my experience) at once.

I am doing with 24 wallets, but there is possibility to increase the number of wallets.
So, each swap instruction of Pumpfun has less accounts than Raydium, so we can use Lookuptable more effectively than Raydium.

It provides methods for creating, buying from 24 wallets, and selling tokens when you want.

This is the steps of My bundler.

## 1. Creating wallets to buy tokens from the pool you creating.

## 2. Creating Lookuptable

## 3. Extending Lookuptable and simulations of each transactions to bundle

## 4. Bundle createPool with the token of metadata transaction and 3 transactions buying from 24 wallets.

## 5. Sell tokens at once from 24 wallets using bundle when you want

## 6. Gathering Sol from 24 wallets you bundle buy and sell
